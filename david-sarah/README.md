# jQuery with events!

**Author**: Sarah Geyer & David Stoll
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This blog allows users to filter out articles based on author or category and also will dynamically show the 'Home' and 'About' pages, limiting each to their own content only. The articles also only show the first paragraph and can expand to view the whole article (and condense back down to the single paragraph after expansion).

## Getting Started
The user must first review starter code, then add in the event listeners for each of the drop down menus, tabs, and Read On buttons.

## Architecture
Application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery).

## Change Log
03-15-2018 10:20:00 AM: Added event listeers for tabs and populated/added event listeners to drop-down menus.
03-15-2018 11:39:00 AM: Finished events listeners for Read On and Read Less buttons and called all functions.
